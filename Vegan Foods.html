    <h3>A vegan diet is based on plants (such as vegetables, grains, nuts and fruits) and foods made from plants.
        <br>
        Vegans do not eat foods that come from animals, including dairy products and eggs.

    <h4>With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the
        nutrients your body needs.

        If you do not plan your diet properly, you could miss out on essential nutrients, such as calcium, iron,
        vitamin
        B12, iodine and selenium. <br> Olive oil is an excellent vegan substitute for other oils and fats that are
        derived from animals, namely butter. Olive oil also contains several different types of healthy fats as well
        as
        antioxidants, which help promote heart health, relieve inflammation and more.

        Foods that vegans eat:

        There’s a good chance that many of the dishes you currently enjoy either already are vegan or can be made
        vegan
        with
        a few simple adjustments.

        For instance, you can swap meat-based main dishes for meals containing beans, peas, lentils, tofu, tempeh,
        nuts,
        or
        seeds.

        What’s more, you can replace dairy products with plant milks, scrambled eggs with scrambled tofu, honey with
        plant-based sweeteners like molasses or maple syrup, and raw eggs with flaxseed or chia seeds.

        You can also choose from the ever-growing selection of ready-made vegan products, including vegan meats,
        vegan
        cheeses, and vegan desserts.

    <h5 id="main">Just keep in mind that these may be highly processed. So while they are fine to eat in moderation,
        they should
        not
        make up the bulk of a healthy vegan diet.</h5>

                Richa Chadha <br>
                Actor, producer, and political activist Richa Chadha is passionate about meat-free living. The
                Bollywood
                star
                used to be vegetarian before she eventually decided to switch to vegan after “getting sick” of
                dairy.
                “We are
                human beings—we are not meant to consume milk from another mammal,”. “We are not built to
                digest something that’s so heavy on the body.”

                Alia Bhatt <br>
                A vegan of three years, actress Alia Bhatt is passionate about the environment and animal welfare.
                She
                even has
                her own sustainability-focused platform, called Coexist, which is dedicated to raising awareness of
                animal
                welfare, ethical consumption, and environmental preservation.

                “I always wanted to do something good, being in the position where I am today,”. “I
                feel passionately about animals. Having said that, we also need to be protective of our country,
                world,
                and
                space. If we only take care of our own place and don’t worry about the world, then it’s a selfish
                way to
                lead
                our lives. My main aim is to create as much awareness as I can.”

                Riteish and Genelia Deshmukh <br>
                Actors Riteish & Genelia Deshmukh decided to go vegan after their son, Riaan, asked them how they
                could
                still eat chicken if they loved their dog. Since then, they have both spoken out about the
                significant
                health benefits of the lifestyle and have even launched their own plant-based meat line, Imagine
                Meat.

                “As a former carnivore, I know that millions like me are looking for a solution to their meat
                cravings,”
                Riteish said back in 2021. “We spent years looking for the perfect fix until we decided to make it
                ourselves—and we’ve worked for over two years to make this a reality. With our wide range of
                craveable
                plant-based meats, we want to enable everybody to Imagine Meat.”

                Esha Gupta <br>
                Actress Esha Gupta has also worked with PETA in the past and has spoken out about her plant-based
                lifestyle on social media. In 2021, for example, she posted two photos of herself, one of her buying
                fresh fruit and the other of her eating a burger, with the caption: “What people think vegans eat
                vs.
                what we actually eat.” She added: “A plant-based diet is a healthier, more [environmentally]
                conscious
                glowing skin diet.”

                Radhika Madan <br>
                “My character, Tarika, from Angrezi Medium helped me discover vegan foods, and it completely changed
                my
                mindset and gave me a clearer perspective on life,” says Radhika. “I have a lot of leafy greens,
                sattu
                is my source of protein, and there’s so much variety contrary to what people think. I encourage
                everyone
                to try being plant-based – help the animals and yourself, too!”

                Sonam Kapoor <br>
                It's been quite a few years now that Sonam Kapoor has adopted veganism. Through her diet, fashion
                and
                clothing line - Sonam promotes a vegan lifestyle to the fullest. As per multiple interviews, she was
                a
                vegetarian for several years before she adopted veganism and gave up on milk and other dairy
                products.
                In fact, she has been recognised by PETA many a-times for her initiatives for animals. Sonam was
                also
                named PETA India's 'Person of the Year' in 2018. If you follow her on Instagram, you will also find
                her
                being vocal about her love for vegan food. She often gives us sneak-peaks into her exquisite vegan
                meals
                that look both healthy and fancy. And often, these meals leave us drooling too!
